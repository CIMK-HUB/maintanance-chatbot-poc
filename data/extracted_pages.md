6.1  Precautions
Before starting work, make sure that the safety instructions have been read and understood.
DANGER: Crush Hazard
Moving parts can entangle or crush. Always disconnect and lock out power before servicing
to prevent unexpected startup. Failure to do so could result in death or serious injury.
 
 
DANGER: Inhalation Hazard
Before entering the work area, make sure that the atmosphere contains sufficient oxygen
and no toxic gases.
WARNING: Biological Hazard
Infection risk. Rinse the unit thoroughly with clean water before working on it.
CAUTION: Crush Hazard
Make sure that the unit cannot roll or fall over and injure people or damage property.
Make sure that you follow these requirements:
â€¢ Check the explosion risk before you weld or use electrical hand tools.
â€¢ Allow all system and pump components to cool before you handle them.
â€¢ Make sure that the product and its components have been thoroughly cleaned.
â€¢ Before starting work, make sure that the work area is well-ventilated.
â€¢ Do not open any vent or drain valves or remove any plugs while the system is
pressurized. Make sure that the pump is isolated from the system and that pressure is
relieved before you disassemble the pump, remove plugs, or disconnect piping.
Ground continuity verification
A ground (earth) continuity test must always be performed after service.
Maintenance guidelines
During the maintenance and before reassembly, always remember to perform these tasks:
â€¢ Clean all parts thoroughly, particularly O-ring grooves.
â€¢ Change all O-rings, gaskets, and seal washers.
â€¢ Lubricate all springs, screws, O-rings with grease.
During the reassembly, always make sure that existing index markings are in line.
The reassembled drive unit must always be insulation-tested and the reassembled pump
must always be test-run before normal operation.
